        <li>1 pound / 450 grams chopped potato (1" dice), approximately 2 large potatoes</li>
        <li>2 stalks chopped celery</li>
        <li>1 large chopped carrot</li>
        <li>7 ounce / 197 gram tinned whole kernel sweetcorn</li>
        <li>1 pint / 480 ml milk</li>
        <li>1 cup / 240 ml single cream</li>
        <li>2 and half ounce / 75 grams butter</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, finely minced</li>
        <li>3 teaspoons cornflour, mixed to a paste with 2 tablespoons water</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Chop the carrots and celery into half pieces and the potatoes into 1 pieces</li>
        <li>Melt the butter over a low heat in a large saucepan</li>
        <li>Add the garlic, saute for 1 minute then add the chopped celery, carrots and potatoes.</li>
        <li>Mix well to combine with the butter. Cover with a lid and allow to sweat gently over a low heat for 8 minutes until the vegetables start to soften.</li>
        <li>Remove the lid from the pan and add the milk, salt and black pepper. Bring to the boil and then reduce the heat and simmer with the lid OFF for about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Taste the vegetables to ensure they are fully cooked. If they are still a little hard, continue to simmer until they are soft.</li>
        <li>Add the mixed seafood, prawns (shrimp) and sweetcorn (including the liquid from the sweetcorn), mix to combine and bring back to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes until the seafood is warmed through.</li>
        <li>Keep the heat on a slow simmer and stir in the cream.</li>
        <li>Taste for seasoning and add more salt or pepper if necessary.</li>
        <li>Mix the cornflour to a smooth paste with 2 tablespoons of cold water. Drizzle in the cornflour/water mixture stirring continually. Simmer for a further 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Serve in a soup bowl with slices of crusty seeded bread or Irish soda bread.</li>
