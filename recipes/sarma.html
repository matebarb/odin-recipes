    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Sarma is a traditional dish that is enjoyed by many on the Balkans. It is made with a variety of ingredients, including minced meat, rice, and vegetables, which are rolled in cabbage or vine leaves and then cooked in a savory broth.</p>
    <p>The origins of sarma can be traced back to the Ottoman Empire, which ruled over much of the Balkans for centuries. In fact, the word “sarma” is derived from the Turkish word “sarmak,” which means “to wrap.” Sarma is a popular dish in many countries in the region, including Bosnia, Serbia, and Croatia, and each country has its own unique version of the dish.</p>

    </ul>

        <li>3 Tbls. extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>100 g diced smoked speck/pancetta or smoked bones (4 oz)</li>

        <li>400 g (small tin) passata (2 cups)</li>
        <li>1/2 kg shredded sauerkraut (3 cups). Make sure you give it a very good rinse in fresh water before using</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Sarma Preparation</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Take an entire pickled cabbage head. You'll find these on Amazon or in European delicatessens in the chilled section. Wash each leaf thoroughly. Remove the thick part of the stem without tearing the leaves. It's best to allow the leaves to drain on some paper towel or pat each one dry</li>
        <li>Take a large mixing bowl, and combine mincemeat, speck, garlic, parsley leaves, soda water or bicarbonate soda, rice, Vegeta, hot paprika (optional), sweet paprika (optional), breadcrumbs (optional), Salt and pepper, egg & olive oil</li>
        <li>Mix all of the ingredients until well combined</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Let's Roll The Sarma</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>You want each of the leaves to be about the same size so that each cabbage roll cooks at the same time. So go ahead and cut any large leaves in half, and also join two smaller leaves together as you go</li>
        <li>Take approx 3 tablespoons of the minced meat, and gently combine in the palm of your hand. Do not roll or compress as this will make them too dense when you eat them</li>
        <li>Place the meat on the edge of the cabbage leaf and roll away from you. Then tuck in the sides of the leaf gently into the meat. There should be no exposed meat. If there is, remove some of the filling</li>
        <li>Set the sarma aside, and prepare the sauce</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Sarma sauce</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a shallow saucepan, or even better, a Le Creuset cast-Iron dish, splash in some extra virgin olive oil, add the 2 diced onions and cook until transparent on low heat. Then add the 2 diced carrots, diced speck, and parsley. Continue to fry on low heat until carrots start to soften</li>
        <li>Add the shredded sauerkraut and create a layer on the bottom of the saucepan. Now, pack the Croatian sarma into the saucepan. They should be packed close together.</li>
        <li>Pour in boiling water so that it just covers the sarma. Add the passata and a pinch of salt and pepper. Every 30 minutes, give the saucepan a shake (do not stir them or they will break) and let them simmer for 2 hours on a low-medium heat</li>
    </ol>
